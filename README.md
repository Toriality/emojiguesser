EmojiGuesser is a simple and silly fun game where you are tasked with guessing the name of an emoji or which emoji represents a certain word.

<h2 align=center>Features:</h2>

- A sleek and simple UI design that's inspired by the iconic emoji graphic design, leading to a unique look and a user friendly experience
- ***Two entirely different game modes that test your emoji knowledge!***
  - **Guess by emoji**: You'll get one random emoji name and 4 different emojis, guess which emoji is the right one and represents the given name!
  - **Guess by name**: You'll get one random emoji and 4 different emoji names, guess which name is the right one and represents the given emoji!
- All emojis are included! That means over **3,782 possibilities**, do you know them all?
> [!NOTE]
> Certain emojis can display as a combination of two different emojis, flag emojis can be displayed as two letters instead of their emoji and some newer emojis can be missing leading to a blank box being displayed instead. This mostly depends on which browser you are currently using, your mileage may vary.

<h2 align=center>How To Play:</h2>

#### <h3 align=center>😎 https://emojiguesser.vercel.app/ 😎</h3>

<h3 align=center>Choose your gamemode</h3>

The game offers two game modes, you either guess which word an emoji is supposed to be or which emoji a word is supposed to be, **guess by emoji** and **guess by name** respectively, choose whichever sounds more fun to you, or try both!

<h3 align=center>Guessing Time</h3>

In both game modes you will get one emoji or name and 4 different options to choose from, and you need to choose the right option for your given name or emoji, simple, right? An example of both game modes:

| Guess by Emoji: 🥐 | Guess by Name: Croissant |
|     :---:      |     :---:     |
| Option 1: Watermelon     | Option 1: 🍉    |
| Option 2: Croissant       | Option 2: 🥐      |
| Option 3: Smiling Face with Sunglasses     | Option 3: 😎    |
| Option 4: Wolf       | Option 4: 🐺      |

The emoji/word that you've been given and your 4 options, which one is it? Select your option and pray for the best.

<h3 align=center>Aftermath</h3>

After you've selected your option the correct option will be highlighted in green and if your selection wasn't the right one it will be highlighted in red. After that all you can do is click on **Next** and keep guessing until you've had enough.

<h2 align=center>Have Fun! 💚</h2>
